# bamazons

The goal of this assignement was to make a database app called bamazon that is able to search through a database and find an item within.  In its current state the application asks you for an items Id number followed by how many of the item you want. This then searches through the database and finds the item but does nothing more.

The technologies used to achive this were: 
- require
- node  
- mysql
- javascript
- mysql workbench
